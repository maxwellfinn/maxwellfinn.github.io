# Landing Page Creation Workflow

This document defines the complete workflow for creating world-class landing pages. Every page goes through research, psychology-driven copywriting, expert review, and iteration before deployment.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Research

### 1.1 Analyze the Offer
When given a URL or offer details:
- **WebFetch** the existing page to understand current positioning
- Extract key offer elements: price, deliverables, guarantees, bonuses
- Identify the core transformation/outcome promised
- Note any urgency elements or scarcity

### 1.2 Brand Extraction
From the client's website/materials:
- **Primary colors** (hex codes)
- **Secondary/accent colors**
- **Typography** (heading font, body font)
- **Logo** (download to assets folder)
- **Brand voice** (formal, casual, authoritative, friendly)
- **Visual style** (minimal, bold, editorial, playful)

### 1.3 ICP Deep Dive
Research the Ideal Customer Profile:
- **Demographics**: Age, income, profession, location
- **Psychographics**: Values, beliefs, aspirations, fears
- **Current state**: Pain points, frustrations, failed solutions
- **Desired state**: Goals, dreams, what success looks like
- **Objections**: Why they might NOT buy
- **Triggers**: What would make them buy TODAY

### 1.4 2026 CRO & Design Trends
**WebSearch** for current best practices:
- "landing page design trends 2026"
- "highest converting sales page examples 2026"
- "CRO best practices 2026"
- "above the fold optimization 2026"

Key principles to incorporate:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Micro-interactions and subtle animations
- Social proof placement optimization
- Friction-reducing form design
- Trust signal positioning
- Scroll-triggered CTAs
- Video integration patterns
- AI-personalization indicators

## Phase 2: Psychology-Driven Copy Framework

### 2.1 System 1 Triggers (Emotional/Intuitive)
Fast, automatic, emotional responses:

| Trigger | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Visual hierarchy** | Hero image, color contrast, whitespace |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, logos, numbers ("10,000+ customers") |
| **Authority** | Expert endorsements, credentials, media logos |
| **Scarcity** | Limited spots, countdown timers, "only X left" |
| **Urgency** | Deadlines, expiring bonuses, price increases |
| **Reciprocity** | Free value upfront, bonuses, guarantees |
| **Liking** | Relatable stories, founder photos, brand personality |

### 2.2 System 2 Triggers (Rational/Analytical)
Slow, deliberate, logical processing:

| Trigger | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **ROI calculation** | "Pays for itself in X days" |
| **Feature comparison** | vs. alternatives, vs. doing nothing |
| **Risk reversal** | Money-back guarantees, free trials |
| **Specificity** | Exact numbers, timeframes, deliverables |
| **Logic flow** | Problem → Agitate → Solution → Proof → CTA |
| **Objection handling** | FAQ section, preemptive rebuttals |
| **Social validation** | Case studies, before/after, testimonials |

### 2.3 Neuromarketing Principles

**Attention:**
- Pattern interrupts in first 3 seconds
- Contrast and color psychology
- Faces and eye direction (pointing toward CTA)
- Movement and animation (subtle, purposeful)

**Memory:**
- Rule of 3 (three key benefits)
- Concrete vs. abstract language
- Emotional anchoring to key messages
- Repetition of core promise

**Decision:**
- Reduce cognitive load (fewer choices)
- Default options and recommendations
- Loss aversion framing ("Don't miss out")
- Anchoring (show higher price first)

### 2.4 NLP Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Presuppositions** | "When you start seeing results..." |
| **Embedded commands** | "Imagine yourself already achieving..." |
| **Future pacing** | "Picture yourself 30 days from now..." |
| **Sensory language** | "Feel the confidence... see the results..." |
| **Cause-effect** | "Because you're reading this, you already know..." |
| **Mind reading** | "You're probably wondering if this will work for you..." |
| **Modal operators** | "You can... You will... You deserve..." |

### 2.5 Behavioral Economics

- **Anchoring**: Show original price before discount
- **Loss aversion**: Frame as what they'll lose by not acting
- **Endowment effect**: "Your transformation is waiting"
- **Sunk cost**: Reference time already spent on problem
- **Social proof**: "Join 10,000+ others who..."
- **Commitment/consistency**: Small yes before big yes
- **Peak-end rule**: Strong opening, powerful close

## Phase 3: Expert Review Panel

Before finalizing any landing page, it must be reviewed by a panel of 10 virtual experts. Each expert evaluates the page from their specialty and provides:
1. **Detailed feedback** (specific, actionable)
2. **Score** (0-100)

### The Expert Panel

| Expert | Specialty | Evaluation Focus |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **David Ogilvy** | Classic Copywriting | Headlines, long-form persuasion, brand voice |
| **Claude Hopkins** | Scientific Advertising | Specificity, offers, testing mentality |
| **Gary Halbert** | Direct Response | Hooks, curiosity, emotional triggers |
| **Joanna Wiebe** | Conversion Copywriting | Voice of customer, clarity, CTA optimization |
| **Peep Laja** | CRO Expert | Friction points, trust signals, page flow |
| **Robert Cialdini** | Persuasion Psychology | 7 principles application, ethical influence |
| **Daniel Kahneman** | Behavioral Economics | System 1/2 balance, cognitive biases |
| **Richard Bandler** | NLP | Language patterns, embedded commands |
| **Oli Gardner** | Landing Page Design | Attention ratio, visual hierarchy, mobile UX |
| **Oren Klaff** | Pitch Expert | Frame control, status alignment, intrigue |

### Scoring Criteria

Each expert scores on these dimensions (weighted):

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Headline Impact** | 15% | Does it stop scrolling? Create curiosity? |
| **Value Proposition Clarity** | 15% | Is the offer crystal clear in 5 seconds? |
| **Emotional Resonance** | 15% | Does it connect with ICP pain/desire? |
| **Credibility & Trust** | 15% | Are there sufficient proof elements? |
| **Visual Design** | 10% | Is it beautiful, on-brand, professional? |
| **Copy Quality** | 10% | Is writing tight, persuasive, scannable? |
| **CTA Optimization** | 10% | Are CTAs compelling, visible, friction-free? |
| **Mobile Experience** | 5% | Does it work perfectly on mobile? |
| **Psychology Application** | 5% | Are principles applied correctly? |

### Minimum Threshold

**The page must score 90+ average across all experts before deployment.**

If below 90:
1. Compile all expert feedback
2. Identify lowest-scoring dimensions
3. Make targeted improvements
4. Re-submit for review
5. Repeat until 90+ achieved

## Invoking This Workflow

To trigger the full workflow, provide:

1. **Offer URL** (or detailed description)
2. **Brand materials** (logo, screenshots, or website URL)
3. **Any existing assets** (images, testimonials, etc.)
4. **Special requirements** (specific CTA URL, deadline, etc.)

Example prompt:
```
Create a landing page for [URL].
Brand assets are in the [folder] directory.
CTA should go to [destination].
No approvals needed after plan approval.
```

The system will then execute all phases automatically, including the expert review loop, and deliver a 90+ scored landing page to production.
